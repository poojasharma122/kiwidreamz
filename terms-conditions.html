                        and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all

                        representation of any kind that the Service will meet Your requirements, achieve any
                        intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, applications,

                        provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as
                        to the operation or availability of the Service, or the information, content, and

                        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties or
                        limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above
                        exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case the exclusions
